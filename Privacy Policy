## Data Collection

Flux **does not** collect any personally identifiable information.

All settings and data are stored **locally on the user's device** using Chrome’s local storage. This includes:
*   Blocked domains list
*   Temporary access allowances
*   Visit counts
*   Extension preferences

No data is sent to external servers.

## Permissions Usage

Flux requires specific permissions strictly to function as intended. Here is how each permission is used:

- `All URLs` (`<all_urls>`)  
  Used solely to compare the URL of the current tab against your block list to determine if access should be restricted.

- `webNavigation`  
  Used to detect page navigations (including Single Page Applications) instantly, ensuring blocked sites are intercepted before they load.

- `tabs`  
  Used only to redirect tabs that match a blocked domain to the local "Block" page.

- `storage`  
  Used to save your preferences and settings locally on your device.

- `alarms`  
  Used to manage the timer for temporary access allowances (e.g., allowing a site for 5 minutes).

**Note:** Flux does **not** read, access, or analyze page content, form inputs, cookies, or browsing history beyond checking the current URL against your block list.

## Data Sharing

Flux does not sell, share, or transfer any user data to third parties. Since no data is collected or transmitted, there is no data to share.

## Third-Party Services

Flux does not use any third-party analytics, tracking tools, or external services.

## Data Security

All data handled by Flux remains entirely on the user's local device. Since there is no data transmission to external servers, the risk of remote data breaches is eliminated.
