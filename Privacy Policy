# Privacy Policy for Flux

Flux does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.

## Data Collection
Flux does not collect any personally identifiable information.  
All settings and data, including blocked domains, temporary allowances, visit counts, and extension preferences, are stored **locally on the user's device** using Chrome’s local storage.

## Permissions Usage
Flux uses the following permissions strictly for its core functionality:

- **All URLs**  
  Used only to compare the current page URL with the user-defined block list in order to determine whether a website should be blocked.

- **webNavigation**  
  Used to detect page navigations, including single-page applications (SPA), so that blocked websites can be intercepted immediately.

- **tabs**  
  Used only to redirect tabs that match blocked domains to a local block page.

- **storage**  
  Used to save user settings locally on the device.

- **alarms**  
  Used to manage time-based temporary access allowances for blocked websites.

Flux does not read or access page content, form inputs, cookies, or browsing history beyond the current page URL.

## Data Sharing
Flux does not sell, share, or transfer any user data to third parties.

## Third-Party Services
Flux does not use any third-party analytics, tracking tools, or external services.

## Data Security
All data handled by Flux remains on the user's local device and is not transmitted to any external servers.

## Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated if the functionality of the extension changes.  
Any updates will be reflected on this page.
